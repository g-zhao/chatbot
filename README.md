#chatbot

##Introduction
This is an application I made from scratch during the time I was taking a coding bootcamp, it allows me to apply some of the concepts learned and utilize the technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, SQL Server, and API exposure/consumption. The idea behind it is similar but broken down in a very elementary way of how an actual chatbot would function which takes in the user input and processes it through a natural language processor such as Luis (which is in the roadmap to implement!) and then an appropropriate response is sent back to the user. In order to have a topic and relevant responses I utilized the coding boot camp's website as an example.
